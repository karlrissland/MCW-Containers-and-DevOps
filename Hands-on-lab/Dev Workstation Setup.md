# Containers and DevOps before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

    - Trial subscriptions will *not* work.

    - You must have rights to create a service principal as discussed in Task 9: Create a Service Principal --- and this typically requires a subscription owner to log in. You may have to ask another subscription owner to login to the portal and execute that step ahead of time if you do not have the rights.

    - You must have enough cores available in your subscription to create the build agent and Azure Kurbernetes Service cluster in Task 5: Create a build agent VM and Task 10: Create an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster. You'll need eight cores if following the exact instructions in the lab, more if you choose additional agents or larger VM sizes. If you execute the steps required before the lab, you will be able to see if you need to request more cores in your sub.

2. A VisualStudio.com account.

3. Local machine or a virtual machine configured with:

    - A browser, preferably Chrome for consistency with the lab implementation tests.

    - Command prompt.

         i.  On Windows, you will be using PowerShell.

         ii. On Mac, all instructions should be executed using bash in Terminal.

4. You will be asked to install other tools throughout the exercises.

>Note: Screen captures may be slightly different as the Azure Portal and Azure DevOps are frequently updated.

## Provision Dev Workstation in Azure

**Duration**: 20min

You should follow all of the steps provided in this section *before* taking part in the hands-on lab ahead of time as some of these steps take time.

### Task 1: Prepare your development environment

You will deploy the development workstation to your azure subscription.  This will create the resource group you will use throughout this lab as well as your development VM.  The ARM template performs the following;
- Creates a virtual network
- Creates a virtual machine
- Installs Hyper-V on the VM
- Installs Docker-Desktop on the VM

1.  Click the 'Deploy to Azure' button

    <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fkarlrissland%2FMCW%2DContainers%2Dand%2DDevOps%2Fmaster%2FHands%2Don%2Dlab%2FEnvironments%2FWorkshopEnv.json" target="_blank">
    <img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/></a> 
    
    This will take you to the Azure Portal, log you in, and show you the custom template deployment screen prompting you for deployment parameters.  **NOTE:** The default user name is "sysadmin" and the default password is "Password$123".

2.  For the **Resource Group**, select to Create New and enter something like "fabmedical-SUFFIX".

    ![This is a screenshot of the deploy to azure screen showing how to create a new resource group.](media/b4-t1-i1.png)

3.  Check the **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above** checkbox and then click the **Purchase** button.  Deploying the VM should take about 15 minutes.  This is a good time to start reviewing the Hands-on lab step by step documentation.

    ![Shows the ckeckbox and purchase button](media/b4-t1-i2.png)

4. Sit back and wait.  It will take about 15-20min to deploy and configure the development environment.  You can monitor the process via the notifications menu option at the top right of the azure portal.

     ![Shows the notification icon in the Azure portal](media/b4-t1-i3.png)

    You can get more detail about the deployment by clicking the Deployment Process link.

    ![Shows detailed deployment status](media/b4-t1-i4.png)

    When your deployment is complete, you can click the link to the resource group to review the services that have been created and remote into your new dev workstation.

> **Note: If you experience errors related to lack of available cores, you may have to delete some other compute resources or request additional cores to your subscription and then try this again.**

>**Note: If you plan on using this workstation for an extended period of time, it is recomended that you turn on [just in time access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-just-in-time) to your VM and setup an [auto shutdown policy](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-auto-shutdown-for-vms-using-azure-resource-manager/)**

### Task 2: Configure your dev environment

Your development VM is almost ready.  Once you login for the first time, a script will run that will complete the process.  The script will configure the following;
- Install Goggle Chrome
- Install Postman
- Install Azure CLI
- Install Kubernetes CLI
- Install Helm CLI
- Install Visual Studio Code and add several extensions
- Kick off Docker-Desktop
The script should take about 5 minutes to complete.
> 


1.  From the Azure Portal, select the resource group you created when you deployed the template in Task 1 and click on vmdev01.

    ![Shows provisioned resource group with dev vm highlighted](media/b4-t2-i1.png)

2.  Click connect, download the RDP file, and open the RDP file.
    
    ![Shows dev vm overview with connect button highlighted](media/b4-t2-i2.png)

    ![Shows connect to virtual machine dialog](media/b4-t2-i3.png)

3.  Enter the user name and password you used when you deployed the template.  **Note: choose 'Use a different account' and enter '.\sysadmin' as the user and 'Password$123' as the password if you kept the defaults**

    ![Shows Login Screen](media/b4-t2-i4.png)

    Select 'Yes' on the Remote Desktop Connection Dialog.

    ![Shows RDP connection Dialog](media/b4-t2-i5.png)

4.  Once you login, a script will kick off which will install additional tools.

    ![Shows configuration script kicking off](media/b4-t2-i6.png)


5.  When the script is finished, after about 5min, it will launch Docker-Desktop and copy a script to your desktop.  
    >**Note: The script on your desktop can be used if you need to reinstall some of the tools.**  

    Click "OK" in the Docker Desktop dialog that stats support is depricated.  This will start docker on the development machine.

    ![Shows Docker Desktop Deprication Dialog](media/b4-t2-i7.png)

    ![Shows Docker Starting](media/b4-t2-i8.png)

6. After about 5min You will be prompted to login to Docker.  If you don't have a docker account and don't want to create one, you can simply close the dialog.  Docker is now up and running.
    
    ![Shows docker welcome](media/b4-t2-i9.png)

Your development workstation is now up and running.  The rest of this document is used to setup a local development environment.

## Configure your local Windows Machine (Optional)
To use a local windows Machine, you will need to be running Windows 10 with the Hyper-V feature enabled and have permissions to install software on your machine.  If you are not sure, it is highly recomended that you use the development environment we provision in Azure.  Lastly, depending on your configuration, reboots may be required.

**Duration**: 20min

#Task 1 Configure Hyper-V, Install Docker Desktop
1. Hyper-V
2. Docker Desktop
3. Quick Test

#Task 2 Install Development Tools
1. Visual Studio Code
2. Azure CLI
3. Kubernetes CLI

Your local Windows 10 Machine is now setup for the lab.  The rest of this document is used to setup an OSX based dev environment.

## Configure your local OSX Machine (Optional)
To use a local OSX Machine, you will need to have permissions to install software on your machine.  If you are not sure, it is highly recomended that you use the development environment we provision in Azure.  Lastly, depending on your configuration, reboots may be required.

**Duration**: 20min

#Task 1 Install Docker Desktop
1. Docker Desktop
2. Quick Test

#Task 2 Install Development Tools
1. Visual Studio Code
2. Azure CLI
3. Kubernetes CLI

Your local OSX Machine is now setup for the lab.


You should follow the steps to prep a development environment in Azure or on your local machine prior to starting the Hands-on-Lab.
