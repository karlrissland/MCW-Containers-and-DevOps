# Containers and DevOps before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

    - Trial subscriptions will *not* work.

    - You must have rights to create a service principal as discussed in Task 9: Create a Service Principal --- and this typically requires a subscription owner to log in. You may have to ask another subscription owner to login to the portal and execute that step ahead of time if you do not have the rights.

    - You must have enough cores available in your subscription to create the build agent and Azure Kurbernetes Service cluster in Task 5: Create a build agent VM and Task 10: Create an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster. You'll need eight cores if following the exact instructions in the lab, more if you choose additional agents or larger VM sizes. If you execute the steps required before the lab, you will be able to see if you need to request more cores in your sub.

2. A VisualStudio.com account.

3. Local machine or a virtual machine configured with:

    - A browser, preferably Chrome for consistency with the lab implementation tests.

    - Command prompt.

         i.  On Windows, you will be using PowerShell.

         ii. On Mac, all instructions should be executed using bash in Terminal.

4. You will be asked to install other tools throughout the exercises.

## Before the hands-on lab

**Duration**: 30min

You should follow all of the steps provided in this section *before* taking part in the hands-on lab ahead of time as some of these steps take time.

### Task 1: Prepare your development environment

You will deploy the development workstation to your azure subscription.  This will create the resource group you will use throughout this lab as well as your development VM.  The ARM template performs the following;
- Creates a virtual network
- Creates a virtual machine
- Installs Hyper-V on the VM
- Installs Docker-Desktop on the VM

> **Note: Setting up the development machine is optional.  You can isntall the development tools onto your local Windows, MacOSX, or Linux development workstation.**
> 
> **You can find instructions and scripts [here](/Local Machine Setup.md).  When done, skip to Task 4**

1.  Click the "deploy to Azure" Button.  This will take you to the Azure Portal, log you in, and show you the custom template deployment screen prompting you for deployment parameters.  **NOTE:** The default user name is "sysadmin" and the default password is "Password$123".

2.  For the **Resource Group**, select to Create New and enter something like "fabmedical-SUFFIX".

    ![This is a screenshot of the deploy to azure screen showing how to create a new resource group.](media/b4-t1-i1.png)

3.  Check the **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above** checkbox and then click the **Purchase** button.  Deploying the VM should take about 15 minutes.  This is a good time to start reviewing the Hands-on lab step by step documentation.

    ![Shows the ckeckbox and purchase button](media/b4-t1-i2.png)

4. Sit back and wait.  It will take about 15-20min to deploy and configure the development environment.  You can monitor the process via the notifications menu option at the top right of the azure portal.

     ![Shows the notification icon in the Azure portal](media/b4-t1-i3.png)

    You can get more detail about the deployment by clicking the Deployment Process link.

    ![Shows detailed deployment status](media/b4-t1-i4.png)

    When your deployment is complete, you can click the link to the resource group to review the services that have been created and remote into your new dev workstation.

    ![Shows the completed deployment](media/b4-t1-i5.png)
    
>**Note: If you plan on using this workstation for an extended period of time, it is recomended that you turn on [just in time access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-just-in-time) to your VM and setup an [auto shutdown policy](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-auto-shutdown-for-vms-using-azure-resource-manager/)**

### Task 2: Configure your dev environment

Your development VM is almost ready.  Once you login for the first time, a script will run that will complete the process.  The script will configure the following;
- Install Goggle Chrome
- Install Postman
- Install Azure CLI
- Install Kubernetes CLI
- Install Helm CLI
- Install Visual Studio Code and add several extensions
- Kick off Docker-Desktop
The script should take about 5 minutes to complete.
> 


1.  From the Azure Portal, select the resource group you created when you deployed the template in Task 1 and click on vmdev01.

    ![Shows provisioned resource group with dev vm highlighted](media/b4-t2-i1.png)

2.  Click connect, download the RDP file, and open the RDP file.
    
    ![Shows dev vm overview with connect button highlighted](media/b4-t2-i2.png)

    ![Shows connect to virtual machine dialog](media/b4-t2-i3.png)

3.  Enter the user name and password you used when you deployed the template.  **Note: choose 'Use a different account' and enter '.\sysadmin' as the user and 'Password$123' as the password if you kept the defaults**

    ![Shows Login Screen](media/b4-t2-i4.png)

    Select 'Yes' on the Remote Desktop Connection Dialog.

5.  When the script is finished, after about 5min, it will launch Docker-Desktop and copy a script to your desktop.  
    >**Note: The script on your desktop can be used if you need to reinstall some of the tools.**  

    Click "OK" in the Docker Desktop dialog that stats support is depricated.  This will start docker on the development machine.

    ![Shows Docker Desktop Deprication Dialog](media/b4-t2-i7.png)

6. After about 5min You will be prompted to login to Docker.  If you don't have a docker account and don't want to create one, you can simply close the dialog.  Docker is now up and running.
    
    ![Shows docker welcome](media/b4-t2-i9.png)

### Task 3: Validate your environment (Optional, everything should be good)

We are going to run a couple of tests to make sure your environment is setup correctly.  We are going to;
- Open Visual Studio Code
- Open a PowerShell Terminal Window
- Verify we can run a docker container
- Verify we have various command line tools installed and running

1. Verify you have Google Chrome, Setup_tools, Visual studio Code, and Postman installed by noting the shortcuts have been placed on your desktop.

    ![Shows Desktop icons](media/b4-t3-i1.png)

2. Open Visual Studio Code (the blue icon) and verify extensions are installed.
     >**Note: VSCode will open a browser window which will prompt you to choose your default browser, select Chrome and click OK.**

     ![Shows Browser Default Dialog](media/b4-t3-i2.png)

     Next, verify VSCode is showing the three icons highlighted below.  These represent your Azure, Kubernetes, and Docker extensions.

### Task 5: Create Azure Resources needed for the lab

The lab uses several Azure services.  In this task we will use the Azure CLI to deploy the services into the resource group you created in step 1.  We will create the following in your Azure subscription;
- Azure Service Principle
- Azure Container Registry
- Azure Kubernetes Cluster
- Azure CosmosDB

>**Note: All of these resources could have been provisioned with the development workstation.  It was a choice to have you manually provision the resources to gain exposure to the Azure CLI.**

1. Open Visual Studio Code and Open a PowerShell terminal window.
   
    ![Shows opening the terminal window](media\b4-t5-i1.png)

    ![Shows the terminal window configured as powershell](media\b4-t5-i2.png)

    ![](media\b4-t5-i5.png)

3. (Optional) If you are using your local development workstation, you will need to create a resourcegroup 
   `az group create --name <myresourcegroupname>`
   ![Shows the creation of the resource group](media\b4-t5-i6.png)

4. Create an Azure Container Registry by executing the following command in the terminal window
   `az acr create --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --name <containerRegistryName> --sku basic`
   ![Shows the creation of the container registry](media\b4-t5-i7.png)

5. Create an Azure Kubernetes Cluster by executing the following command in the terminal window


    `az aks create --resource-group <yours> --name fabmedAKSCluster --node-count 2 --enable-addons monitoring --generate-ssh-keys`

    
    ![Shows the creation of the kubernetes cluster](media\b4-t5-i8.png)

    >**Note: this takes a little while**

    ![Shows AKS deployment complete](media\b4-t5-i9.png)

6. Create an Azure CosmosDB instance by executing the following command in the terminal window
   
    `az cosmosdb create --resource-group <yours> --name FabMedCosmos --kind MongoDB --locations "East US" --default-consistency-level "ConsistentPrefix"`
    ![Shows the creation of CosmosDB](media\b4-t5-i10.png)

    >**Note: this takes a few moments**

    ![Shows cosmos db complete provision](media\b4-t5-i11.png)

7. Go to the Azure Portal and take a look at your resource group to verify the services have been created.

    ![Shows the resource group with all the provisioned services](media\b4-t5-i12.png)


> **Note: If you experience errors related to lack of available cores, you may have to delete some other compute resources or request additional cores to your subscription and then try this again.**

You should follow all steps provided *before* performing the Hands-on lab.
